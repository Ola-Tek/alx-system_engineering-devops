Perhaps the most common type of replication is RAID. RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks. This means that in most configurations, disks mirror each other in one way or another.

The most basic redundant RAID implementation is a RAID 1 array. This type of array mirrors one disk on another disk. This means that if one disk fails, the other is still available to serve and write data. This type of array speeds up reads due to the fact that the system can read from either of the data locations.
